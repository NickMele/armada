//! The daemon: the scheduler, Drone lifecycle, worktrees, the Job-shape
//! classifier, and the Evidence MCP the Drone reports through.
//!
//! Daemon OS lifecycle is its own module, orthogonal to scheduling — v1 mixed
//! them and its `schedule.rs` alone reached 2,929 lines.

//! # Two things that are not details
//!
//! **`libc::setsid()` at every Drone spawn, always.** launchd signals a job's
//! whole process tree, so an undetached Drone dies at every Fleet restart,
//! silently and mid-Job.
//!
//! **Fleet never auto-kills.** Anything escalated is paused with its worktree
//! held as-is. Killing is exclusively a human action.
//!
//! Fleet is also the only writer of Job state, and it reaches the agent only
//! through `adapter-traits` — never the real CLI directly, anywhere.
